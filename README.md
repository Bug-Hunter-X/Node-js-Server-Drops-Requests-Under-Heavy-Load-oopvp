# Node.js Server Request Dropping Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js servers where requests can be dropped under heavy load due to the asynchronous nature of the `res.end()` method. The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.

## Problem Description

The original server code fails to reliably handle multiple simultaneous requests. Because `res.end()` is asynchronous, the server might close the connection prematurely, leaving some clients without a response.  This becomes increasingly problematic with a high request rate.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the server processes all responses completely before closing the connection.  Proper event handling is used to prevent premature connection closure.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Use a tool like `ab` (Apache Bench) or `wrk` to send multiple requests simultaneously to the server.  Observe that some requests may not receive a response.
4. Replace `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js` and repeat step 3.  The improved version should handle all requests successfully.

## Lessons Learned

This demonstrates the importance of understanding the asynchronous nature of Node.js and the need for proper error and event handling, especially in scenarios involving high concurrency.
